RoadMap:

- General
  - [x] Imgui integration
  - [x] Different files per scene
  - [x] Makefile
  - [ ] CMake/Premake files to create VS slns and Code Blocks Projects

---

- Demos
  - [x] Bezier Lines
  - [ ] Culling demo
  - [ ] Matrix operations
  - [ ] Texture mapping
  - [ ] Different shading techniques (Gourad, Phong, Flat)
  - [ ] Frustrum demo
  - [ ] Lighting
  - [ ] Camera movement
  - [ ] 2D transformations
  - [ ] Normal mapping
  - [ ] Raycasting
  - [ ] Lerp and other built in OpenGL functions
